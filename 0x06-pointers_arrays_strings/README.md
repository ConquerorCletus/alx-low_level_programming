# 0x06 - Pointer, Array and String.
This directory of this repository is a continuation of [0x05](https://github.com/ConquerorCletus/alx-low_level_programming/tree/master/0x05-pointers_arrays_strings) pointer, string and array. More advance task would be done which involver pointers and string manipulations.

## Resources
some resources that helped me complete this taskare;
1. [programmiz c-strings and function](https://youtu.be/XdnmsKUvGsc)
2. [c-pointer](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/cprogramming/c_pointers.htm)

i don't know why the checker is being released late but i would still figure my way around the task....
