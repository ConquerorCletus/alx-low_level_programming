+ The \* tells that the variable(var) is a pointer.
+ That points to var_type.
+ The value of var will be a memory address holding a value of var_type.


## Arrays.
These are contiguous memory area that holds a number of values of the same type. To learn more about arrays, click [here](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/cprogramming/c_arrays.htm).
#### 
    var_type varName[number_of_element];

## Strings.
These are one dimensional array of characters terminated by a null character '\0'. Thus a null terminated string contains the character that comprise the string followed by a null. more details [here](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/cprogramming/c_strings.htm).
