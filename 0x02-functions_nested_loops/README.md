# 0x02. C - Functions, nested loops
## Functions.
A function is a group of statements that together perform a task. Every C program has at least one function. you can read more [here](http://www.tutorialspoint.com/cprogramming/c_functions.htm).

## Nested Loops.
This are loops within another loop in any programming syntax. you can read more [here](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.geeksforgeeks.org/nested-loops-in-c-with-examples/amp/).

### Task Requirements for 0x02.
+ Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs.
+ Your code should use the Betty style. It will be checked using betty-style.pl and betty-doc.pl. i.e it must be betty compliant.
+ You are not allowed to use global variables.
+ You are not allowed to use the standard library. Any use of functions like printf, puts, etc… is forbidden.
+ The prototypes of all your functions should be included in **main.h** file.

so i would be performing all my task related to 0x02-C functions and nested loops as directed by alx.
